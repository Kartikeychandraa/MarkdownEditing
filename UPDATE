DESCRIBE SUBLIME TEXT?
Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.
DIFFENCE BETWEEN NOTEPAD AND SUBLIME TEXT .
One notable difference (and I'd say probably the biggest difference right away) is that Sublime Text is "cross platform" and has a version for Windows, Linux, and Mac. That makes it attractive since I work on multiple platforms. (Work computers are Linux, home computer is Windows).
